# MakeSchoolApp

Objective:
  One is an app that lets you aggregate your Twitter, Instagram feeds into one application.

Audience:
  The audience I'm targeting is the teenager, or anyone who uses two of these social services. The app will be used regardless of the disposable income of the person. I perdict the app will be used when the person is bored or wants to socialize with his/her friends.

Technical:
  I'm using the Twitter API, Instagram API

Screens:
  Home Screen--Shows the timeline for the selected mode of the app. Modes are: Timeline, Twitter Only, Instagram Only
  
  Search Screen--Searchs and shows results for the selected mode of the app. Timeline mode will search Twitter and Instagram, Twitter mode will search Twitter only, Instagram mode will search Instagram only.
  
  Notifications--Shows the notifications for the selected mode of the app. Timeline mode will show the notifications for Twitter and say that Instagram doesn't allow notification access, Twitter mode will show the notifications for Twitter only, Instagram mode will say that Instagram doesn't allow notification access.
  
  Profile--Shows a tableView of accounts that are linked up and when you select one it will show you that profile.

Experience:
  The user will want to use the app as a replacement for the default Twitter and Instagram App. The benifit would be eliminating the hassle of switching between these apps.
